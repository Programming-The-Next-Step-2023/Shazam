# Shazam Project
I propose to build something that resembles Shazam, to be able to recognise songs.

The user can play a short part of a song, my package will tell the user what song it is. This will be achieved through 
fourier transformation of songs as an identifier of a song. Possibly a neural network or machine learning will be used 
to train the model what audio parts respond to what song.
